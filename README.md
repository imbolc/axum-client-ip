Client IP address extractors for Axum

## V1 breaking changes

- Removed `InsecureClientIp` and related "leftmost" IP logic. The library now
  focuses solely on secure extraction based on trusted headers.
- Renamed `SecureClientIp` to `ClientIp`.
- Renamed `SecureClientIpSource` to `ClientIpSource`.

The changes are triggered by
["rightmost" IP extraction bug](https://github.com/imbolc/axum-client-ip/issues/32).

## Configurable vs specific extractors

There's a configurable [`ClientIp`] extractor you can use to make your
application independent from a proxy it can run behind (if any) and also
separate extractors for each proxy / source header.

| Extractor / `ClientIpSource` Variant | Header Used                 | Typical Proxy / Service                                 |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `CfConnectingIp`                     | `CF-Connecting-IP`          | Cloudflare                                              |
| `CloudFrontViewerAddress`            | `CloudFront-Viewer-Address` | AWS CloudFront                                          |
| `FlyClientIp`                        | `Fly-Client-IP`             | Fly.io                                                  |
| `RightmostForwarded`                 | `Forwarded`                 | Proxies supporting RFC 7239 (extracts rightmost `for=`) |
| `RightmostXForwardedFor`             | `X-Forwarded-For`           | Nginx, Apache, HAProxy, CDNs, LBs                       |
| `TrueClientIp`                       | `True-Client-IP`            | Cloudflare, Akamai                                      |
| `XRealIp`                            | `X-Real-Ip`                 | Nginx                                                   |
| `ConnectInfo`                        | N/A (uses socket address)   | No proxy, e.g. listening directly to 80 port            |

## Configurable extractor

The configurable extractor assumes initializing [`ClientIpSource`] at runtime
(e.g. with an environment variable). This makes sense when you ship a
pre-compiled binary, people meant to use in different environments. Here's an
initialization [example].

## Specific extractors

Specific extractors don't require runtime initialization, but you'd have to
recompile your binary when you change proxy server.

```rust,no_run
// With the renaming, you have to change only one line when you change proxy
use axum_client_ip::XRealIp as ClientIp;

async fn handler(ClientIp(ip): ClientIp) {
    todo!()
}
```
